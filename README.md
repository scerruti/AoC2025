# Advent of Code 2025


This repository contains my solutions and write-ups for the 2025 Advent of Code event.

**Note:** Solutions are written with the AP Computer Science A (AP CSA) Java subset in mind, for educational and reference purposes.


## Key AP CSA Learning Features (2025)

This project highlights AP Computer Science A (AP CSA) concepts and learning objectives through Advent of Code problems. Each day is annotated with relevant Java subset features and AP CSA Learning Objectives (LOs).


### [Day 1: Dial Simulation](writeups/Day01.md)
- **String parsing**: Using `substring` and `equals` to extract and compare characters.
- **Integer parsing**: Using `Integer.parseInt` to convert string input to numbers.
- **Loops**: Iterating over a `List` of input lines with a for-each loop.
- **Arithmetic and modulo**: Handling wraparound logic with addition, subtraction, and modulo operations.
- **Conditionals**: Using `if`, `else if`, and `else` to handle multiple cases.
- **AP CSA LO:**
	- **LO 3.2.1: Iteration Statements** (for-each, while, for)
	- **LO 3.1.1: Boolean Expressions** (if/else, relational operators)
	- **LO 3.4.1: String Methods** (`substring`, `equals`)
	- **LO 3.5.1: Casting and Math** (Integer parsing, arithmetic)



## About

Feedback and suggestions are welcome!

## Tips for Advent of Code

- Test your solution with the provided examples before submitting.
- If stuck, re-read the puzzle and try building your own test cases.
- Do not include puzzle text or input files from the AoC website in your repo.
- Solutions must be your own work—AI assistance is not allowed for solving puzzles.
