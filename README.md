# Advent of Code 2025 Java Project

This project is set up for solving Advent of Code 2025 puzzles in Java. Each day's solution should be placed in the `src/main/java/aoc2025/solutions` directory.

## Structure
- `src/main/java/aoc2025/solutions/` — Place each day's solution here (e.g., `Day01.java`, `Day02.java`, ...)
- `src/test/java/aoc2025/` — Place your tests here

## Getting Started
- Requires Java 17 or later
- Uses Maven for build and dependency management

## Build and Run
To compile the project:
```
mvn compile
```
To run the main class:
```
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="aoc2025.Main"
```

## Add a New Solution
1. Create a new file in `src/main/java/aoc2025/solutions/` (e.g., `Day01.java`)
2. Implement your solution in that file
3. Optionally, add tests in `src/test/java/aoc2025/`

Happy coding!
