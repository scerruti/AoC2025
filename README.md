# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions and write-ups for the 2025 Advent of Code event.

**Note:** Solutions are written with the AP Computer Science A (AP CSA) Java subset in mind, for educational and reference purposes.

## Key AP CSA Learning Features (2025)

This project highlights AP Computer Science A (AP CSA) concepts and learning objectives through Advent of Code problems. Each day is annotated with relevant Java subset features and AP CSA Learning Objectives (LOs).

### [Day 1: Dial Simulation](writeups/Day01.md)
- **String parsing**: Using `substring` and `equals` to extract and compare characters.
- **Integer parsing**: Using `Integer.parseInt` to convert string input to numbers.
- **Loops**: Iterating over a `List` of input lines with an **enhanced `for` loop**.
- **Arithmetic and modulo**: Handling wraparound logic with addition, subtraction, and modulo operations.
- **Conditionals**: Using `if`, `else if`, and `else` to handle multiple cases.
- **AP CSA LOs:**
	- **LO 1.3.C: Arithmetic Expressions** (`%`, `/`)
	- **LO 1.15.B: String Methods** (`substring`, `equals`)
	- **LO 2.3.A / 2.5.A: Selection** (if/else, compound logic)
	- **LO 2.7.B: Iteration** (while loops)
	- **LO 4.7.A: Wrapper Classes** (`Integer.parseInt`)
	- **LO 4.8.A / 4.9.A: Data Collections** (ArrayList creation and enhanced for loop traversal)

## Tips for Advent of Code

- Test your solution with the provided examples before submitting.
- If stuck, re-read the puzzle and try building your own test cases.
- Do not include puzzle text or input files from the AoC website in your repo.
- Solutions must be your own work—AI assistance is not allowed for solving puzzles.
